/* console.log('HW-1')


Easy Going
1. Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20. */

/* for (i = 1; i <= 20; i+=1) {
    console.log(i);
} */


/* Get Even
1. Write a `for` loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.
>Hint: Think about the increment expression. */

/* for (i = 0; i <= 200; i+=2) {
        console.log(i);
    } */


/* Excited Kitten
1. Write code that logs "Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!" 20 times. */

    /* for (i = 1; i<=20; i +=1) {
        console.log('Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!');
}  

2. For every **even** number in your loop, log "...human...why you taking pictures of me?...", "...the catnip made me do it...", or "...why does the red dot always get away..." at random. */
    
/* const kitCat = ["...human...why you taking pictures of me?...", "...the catnip made me do it...", "...why does the red dot always get away..."]
    
    for (i = 0; i<=20; i +=1) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(kitCat[Math.floor(Math.random() * kitCat.length)]);
        } else {
        console.log('Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!');
        }
